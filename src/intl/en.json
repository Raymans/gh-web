  "faq.question.title.diff.f2f.interviews": "How are you different from traditional face to face interviews?",
  "faq.question.title.diff.f2f.interviews.answer": "A: With face to face interviews, you have to make appointments with individual candidates and go through the same interview questions over and over again. While it is manageable when you are screening a small number of candidates, it can easily take up a significant amount of your time when the candidate number grows bigger. We believe that your time is most valuable and should be spent on qualified candidates that meet your basic assessment benchmark.",
  "faq.question.title.diff.video.interviews": "How are you different from conducting video interviews online?",
  "faq.question.title.diff.video.interviews.answer": "A: While it is convenient to conduct virtual interviews, the key difference here is that you are still physically required to engage in these interviews.

We believe using GeekHub online assessment along with video interview tools will solve most interview needs at your company.",
  "faq.question.title.why.free": "Why are we free?",
